Make these final adjustments to the form:

1. MAKE ALL FIELDS OPTIONAL EXCEPT PROPOSED USE:
   - Update form validation to only require: proposed_use
   - Remove asterisks (*) from all other field labels
   - Remove all other fields from the required_fields validation check
   - Only check that proposed_use is not empty
   
   Update validation logic to:
```python
   if submitted:
       # Only validate proposed_use
       if not proposed_use or proposed_use.strip() == '':
           st.error("⚠️ Please enter the Proposed Use (required)")
       else:
           # Form is valid, proceed with generation
           st.success("✅ Form validated successfully!")
           # ... rest of submission logic
```

2. RENAME AND CONSOLIDATE FIELDS:
   In the "Project Type & Use" section:
   
   - REMOVE the field: "Bay/Space Size (sf)"
   - RENAME "Proposed Use SF" to "Proposed Use (Bay/Space Size) (sf)"
   - Keep it as a number input
   - Make it optional (no asterisk)
   - Update help text to: "Square footage dedicated to the proposed use"
   
   The "Project Type & Use" section should now have only 3 fields:
   1. Proposed Use (required - the only required field in entire form)
   2. Proposed Use (Bay/Space Size) (sf) (optional)
   3. Rent or Own Property (optional)
   4. Purchase Price if Own ($) (optional, conditional)

3. ADD STREET ECONOMICS LOGO:
   At the very top of the app, before any other content, add:
```python
   # Add logo at the top
   try:
       from PIL import Image
       logo = Image.open("SE Logo.png")
       
       # Create columns to center the logo
       col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([1, 2, 1])
       with col2:
           st.image(logo, use_container_width=True)
   except Exception as e:
       # If logo fails to load, skip it
       pass
   
   # Then show the main title
   st.markdown('<div class="main-header">Economic Impact Analysis Tool</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
   st.markdown('<div class="sub-header">Street Economics - Homestead CRA Edition</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
   
   Also add to requirements.txt if not already there:
Pillow

4. UPDATE FORM DATA COLLECTION:
   Since we renamed/removed fields, update the form_data dictionary:
   
   - Remove: building_space_size (this was Bay/Space Size)
   - Rename: proposed_use_sf stays the same in the backend (just display name changed)
   
   The form_data collection stays mostly the same, just remove building_space_size reference.

5. UPDATE FIELD LABELS (remove asterisks from optional fields):
   Go through all sections and remove the asterisk (*) from every field EXCEPT:
   - "Proposed Use" - keep the asterisk, this is the only required field
   
   All other fields should be labeled without asterisks since they're optional.

After making these changes:
- Test that logo displays at the top
- Verify only "Proposed Use" is required (try submitting with just that filled)
- Confirm "Proposed Use (Bay/Space Size) (sf)" appears correctly
- Make sure validation only checks for proposed_use
