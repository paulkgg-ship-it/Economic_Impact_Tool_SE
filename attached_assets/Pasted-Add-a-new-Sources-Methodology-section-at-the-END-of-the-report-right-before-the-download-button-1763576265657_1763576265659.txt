**Data Sources:**
- **Economic Multipliers:** Lightcast 2025 data for Homestead/South Dade region (NAICS-specific industry multipliers)
- **Demographics:** Esri 2025 demographic profiles for Homestead, FL
- **Real Estate Data:** CoStar 2025 market data for Homestead commercial properties
- **Fiscal Parameters:** City of Homestead and Miami-Dade County FY 2025 adopted millage rates

**Methodology:**

This analysis uses economic modeling based on the EMSI Type II methodology, which captures:
1. **Direct effects** - the immediate impact of project investment and operations
2. **Indirect effects** - supply chain impacts as businesses purchase goods and services
3. **Induced effects** - household spending impacts as workers spend their earnings in the local economy

**Fiscal Impact Calculations:**
- Incremental taxable value calculated as 60% of hard construction costs (standard capitalization rate for tenant improvements)
- Ad valorem taxes calculated using combined City and County millage rates
- CRA captures 95% of incremental tax revenue; 5% retained by each government
- 10-year projections assume 3% annual property value growth

**Economic Impact Calculations:**
- Construction impacts based on total development costs
- Direct construction jobs estimated at 1 job per $100,000 investment
- Operations impacts based on projected revenue or industry-standard sales per square foot
- Industry-specific multipliers applied to calculate indirect and induced effects
- Job-years represent the cumulative employment over the analysis period (e.g., 10 jobs × 10 years = 100 job-years)

**Conservative Assumptions:**
- Revenue estimates use lower end of industry averages when actual data not provided
- Employment multipliers are region-specific to avoid overstatement
- Growth rates (2.5% output, 1% employment) are conservative relative to historical trends
- All figures rounded to whole dollars

**Limitations:**
- Analysis assumes project is completed and operating as described
- Does not account for economic downturns, market disruptions, or competitive changes
- Multipliers are averages and may vary based on specific supply chain relationships
- Fiscal projections assume stable millage rates and capture percentages

This methodology is consistent with standard economic development impact analysis practices and is designed to provide conservative, defensible estimates for CRA investment decisions.
